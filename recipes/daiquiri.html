    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Daiquiri was supposedly invented in 1898 in the eponymous mining town
      of Daiquiri on the southeastern tip of Cuba by an American mining engineer
      named Jennings Cox. It was introduced in the United States a decade later,
      when a U.S. Navy medical officer brought the recipe from Cuba to
      Washington, D.C.

      This three-ingredient gift has pleased millions of palates over the
      ensuing years, including household names like Ernest Hemingway and
      President JFK. Yet no drink has suffered more abuse than the Daiquiri. In
      the century-plus since its inception, the granddaddy of rum cocktails has
      gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Señor
      Frog’s table tent. Even today, as the craft cocktail movement reaches full
      tilt, most people too often associate the Daiquiri with neon-colored adult
      slushies, the stuff of spring-break blackouts and mind-splitting
      hangovers. But in its purest form, the Daiquiri is simple and sublime, a
      delicate blend of rum’s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime
      juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing those three elements.
      That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying,
      though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose an overly
      sweet rum or use too much sugar, and you’re left sipping liquid candy;
      overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.
