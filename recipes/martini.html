    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Who mixed the world’s first Martini? It’s a good question, but you could
      stumble down a very deep, dark rabbit hole trying to find out. Was it a
      California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the barman at a flossy
      New York City hotel 50 years later? Most likely, the Martini is a cocktail
      that came onto the scene in multiple places at once, as bartenders began
      to experiment with gin and dry vermouth. Regardless, no origin story will
      leave you feeling as blissful and content as you will feel after drinking
      a classic, well-made Dry Martini.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the exacting demands of a certain fictional British spy, the
      Martini is meant to be stirred, not shaken. The cocktail should be clear,
      sans ice shards. But do stir it for a good 20 to 30 seconds to yield the
      proper dilution necessary to bring the ingredients into balance. Then,
      strain it into the glass named after the cocktail itself. Twist a lemon
      peel over the top, and there you have it: a Dry Martini.
